# ReactJS-Weather-API
ReactJS Website with working API


The purpose of this project was to demonstrate how to build a working application using ReactJS as well as using an API call. 

How it works: The user is able to get the current forecast of any location in the world! They must enter the City in which the user wants
for example, London. Then they must enter the Country Code: UK. Once the user clicks  the "Get Weather!" button it will retrieve the Temperature
Conditions and more.

Technologies used: React, React-bootstrap, CSS
